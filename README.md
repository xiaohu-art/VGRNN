# VGRNN implementation in Python 3.8 on cuda 11.3

The idea to implement such a version is because the [office implementation](https://github.com/VGraphRNN/VGRNN) is not compatible with the latest version of python library and cuda.

for basic exeucation:
```bash
python detection.py conv_type=SAGE datasets=fb
```
